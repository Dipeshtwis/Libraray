# Library

> This is the first project in JavaScript module of Microverse main technical curriculum. This project is a simple mock-up of a library where we can add a new book and delete it too. While adding a new book, we are presented with a form where we can input the details of the book including title of the book, author, number of pages and the status of book indicating whether the book has been read or not.
